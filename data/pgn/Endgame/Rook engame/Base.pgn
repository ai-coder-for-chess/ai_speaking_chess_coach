{[#] Before this penultimate round six players were jointly leading with 6/7. I was paired on top board with Vallejo as black.} 54. Kxg5 {Chess is a tough game and rook pawn endgames can be specially the most difficult part. Luckily here my pieces are perfectly placed. Also I knew about the game Sasi - Aronian, World Team 2010 when Sasi won on top board and I was playing on board 3. We had a very close look on this endgame then. Those who haven't seen that I suggest to have a look at that game then my ending will look trivial :)} Rg8+ {The difference with Sasi - Aronian is that here white's rook is placed on e4 instead of e3 which makes my move (Rg8) possible and not a losing move like in Sasi - Aronian.} (54...
