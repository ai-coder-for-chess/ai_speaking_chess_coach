Ba5# {This problem is one of the first recorded application of the Indian theme: a linear piece X moves along a line to cross over a critical square  (this is called a critical move). Another piece Y then occupies this critical square and provisionally interferes with X to avoid a stalemate. In the next move, Y moves unleashing a discovered check. Loveday, an Anglican clergyman placed at the St. James Church in Delhi, India, at the time, presented this problem to the great English chess master Howard Staunton in a letter and signed it as "Shagird," which means disciple in Urdu. Not knowing that it was a term to express admiration, Staunton assumed Shagird was the name of the composer from India. Hence, on the cover of his chess magazine La Palamède, he put this position and called it the Indian problem. That is how this idea came to be known as the Indian theme. It is arguably the most important theme in the literature on chess problems and opened doors to innovations never thought of before. Notably, the great problemist Sam Loyd was one of the first persons to recognize the potential this theme offered, and he churned out a dozen or so magnificent problems using it. However, we will keep our focus on studies here.} *
